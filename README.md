# hello-world

Hi World!

Leah here, I like dogs, reading, and lasagna.
My best friend describes me as "brave, interesting, lovely, truly amazing, and unique" but she might be biased. 
My true talents lie in laughing at my own jokes, pretending I have a sense of direction, and getting teary over reruns of The Office.
